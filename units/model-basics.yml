title: Model intuition
theme: model

desc: |
  This course approaches modelling a little differently to most statistics
  courses. We're not going to rigorously covering the mathematical foundation
  of models. Instead, you'll get some intution about what a model does,
  and then learn some computation tools for exploring fitted models.

  In this unit, you'll build up your intuition for what a model does, and what
  it tells you about a dataset.
