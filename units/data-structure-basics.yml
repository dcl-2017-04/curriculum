desc: "\nIt's helpful to know a little bit about how data structures are organised
  in R. The simplest data structure in R is the vector, which can be broken up in
  to atomic vectors and augmented vectors. Vectors of related data are organised together
  in tibbles and data.frames.\n\n``` r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\nAtomic vectors\n--------------\n\nThe
  atomic vectors are the \"atoms\" of R, the simple building blocks upon which all
  else is built. There are four types of atomic vector that are important for data
  analysis:\n\n-   **logical** vectors `<lgl>` contain `TRUE` or `FALSE`.\n-   **integer**
  vectors `<int>` contain integers.\n-   **double** vectors `<dbl>` contain real numbers.\n-
  \  **character** vector `<chr>` contain strings made with `\"\"`.\n\nAll vectors
  can also contain the missing value `NA`. You'll learn more about missing values
  later on. Collectively integer and double vectors are known as **numeric** vectors.
  The difference is rarely important in R.\n\nYou create atomic vectors by hand with
  the `c()` function:\n\n``` r\nlogical <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)\n\n# The difference
  between the real number 1 and the integer 1 is not \n# usually important, but soemtimes
  it comes up in base R code. R uses\n# the suffix \"L\" to indicate that a number
  is an integer.\ninteger <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)\n\ndouble <- c(1.5, 2.8, pi)\n\ncharacter
  <- c(\"this\", \"is\", \"a character\", \"vector\")\n```\n\nAugmented\n---------\n\nAugmented
  vectors are atomic vectors with additional metadata. There are four important augmented
  vectors:\n\n-   **factors** `<fct>`, which are used to represent categorical variables
  can take one of a fixed and known set of possible values (called the levels).\n\n-
  \  **ordered factors** `<ord>`, which are like factors but where the level have
  an intrinsic ordering (i.e. it's reasonable to say that one level is \"less than\"
  or \"greater than\" another variable).\n\n-   **dates** `<dt>`, record a date.\n\n-
  \  **date-times** `<dttm>`, which are also known as POSIXct, record a date and a
  time.\n\nFor now, you just need to recognise these when you encounter them. You'll
  learn how to create each type of augmented vector later in the course.\n\nData frames/tibbles\n-------------------\n\nRelated
  vectors (both atomic and augment) are collected together into data frames or tibbles.
  Later you'll learn the precise different between data.frames and tibbles, but don't
  worry about it for now. There are two ways to create tibbles by hand:\n\n1.  From
  individual vectors, each representing a column:\n\n    ``` r\n    my_tibble <- tibble(\n
  \     x = c(1, 9, 5),\n      y = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE),\n      z = c(\"apple\",
  \"pear\", \"banana\")\n    )\n    my_tibble\n    #> # A tibble: 3 × 3\n    #>       x
  \    y      z\n    #>   <dbl> <lgl>  <chr>\n    #> 1     1  TRUE  apple\n    #>
  2     9 FALSE   pear\n    #> 3     5 FALSE banana\n    ```\n\n2.  From individual
  values, organised in rows:\n\n    ``` r\n    my_tibble <- tribble(\n      ~x, ~y,
  \   ~z,\n      1,  TRUE,  \"apple\",\n      9,  FALSE, \"pear\",\n      5,  FALSE,
  \"banana\"\n    )\n    my_tibble\n    #> # A tibble: 3 × 3\n    #>       x     y
  \     z\n    #>   <dbl> <lgl>  <chr>\n    #> 1     1  TRUE  apple\n    #> 2     9
  FALSE   pear\n    #> 3     5 FALSE banana\n    ```\n\nTypically it will be obvious
  whether you need to use `tibble()` or `tribble()`. One representation will either
  be much shorter or much clearer than the other.\n\n### Dimensions\n\nWhen you print
  a tibble it tell you its dimensions:\n\n``` r\ndiamonds\n#> # A tibble: 53,940 ×

  you have three options:\n\n``` r\ndim(diamonds)\n#> [1] 53940    10\nnrow(diamonds)\n#>
  [1] 53940\nncol(diamonds)\n#> [1] 10\n```\n"
