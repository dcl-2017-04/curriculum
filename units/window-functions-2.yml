desc: "\n`summarise()` and `mutate()` work at the data frame level: they take a data
  frame as input and return a data frame as output. You combine these data frame functions
  with with vector functions: functions that take a vector as input and return a vector
  as output. The length of the output determines whether a given function work with
  `summarise()` or `mutate()`:\n\n-   `summarise()` works with **summary** functions;
  functions that take `n` inputs and return 1 output. This includes functions like
  `sum()` and `mean()` for numeric vectors; `all()` and `any()` for logical vectors;
  and `str_c()` with `collapse` for character vectors.\n\n-   `mutate()` works with
  **transformation** functions: functions that take `n` inputs and return `n` outputs.
  So far you've mainly used vectorised maps, like `-` and `+`, or `&` and `|`. In
  this unit, you'll learn some finer details of these functions, and learn a new class
  of functions called **window functions**.\n\n``` r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\nVectorised
  map functions\n------------------------\n\n### Unary\n\nThe simplest type of transformation
  function is the \"unary vectorised map\". This is a precise, but complicated name.
  Let's unpack it and explain each component:\n\n-   **Unary** means that the function
  takes a single vector as input.\n\n-   **Vectorised** means that the function takes
  a vector as input and returns a vector of the same length as the output (but possibly
  a different type).\n\n-   **Map** is a mathematical term that means that you can
  independently compute each element of the output from the corresponding piece of
  the input. In other words, if your input is `x` and your output is `z`, the only
  value of `x` that `z[i]` depends on is `x[i]`.\n\nThe diagram below shows a vectorised
  function, focusing on how the input is connected to the output. The input is on
  the left, and the output is on the bottom. You can see how each input affects the
  output by following the lines right and down; you can see how an output is computed
  from the input by following the lines up and left. The connections for a vectorised
  function are simple: each input only affects the output at the same position.\n\n<img
  src=\"diagrams/map.png\" width=\"139\" />\n\nIt's helpful to organise unary vectorised
  maps by the type of input vector:\n\n-   Numeric: most of these come from base R
  and include functions like `log()` and `abs()`, and operators like `!` and `-`.\n\n
  \   ``` r\n    x1 <- c(1, 4, 2)\n    -x1\n    #> [1] -1 -4 -2\n\n    x2 <- c(TRUE,
  FALSE, FALSE)\n    !x2\n    #> [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE\n    ```\n\n-   Character:
  these are provided by stringr and include functions like `str_length()`, `str_lower()`
  and `str_upper()`.\n\n-   Date times: these are provided by lubridate and include
  functions like `yday()` and `year()`.\n\n### Binary\n\nAnother extremely common
  class of transformation functions are the **binary** vectorised maps. These are
  similar to the unary transformation functions except that they take 2 vector inputs.
  You've used many of these functions already because they include the mathematical
  operators `-`, `+`, `/`, `*`, `%%` and `%/%`.\n\nThere is a new wrinkle with these
  functions: since they take two vectors, what happens if they are different lengths?
  For example, in `x * 2` below, `x` has length 5, but `y` has length 1.\n\n``` r\nx
  <- sample(100, 10)\ny <- 2\n\nx * y\n#>  [1] 168 120  32   2  90  96  56 138 144
  160\n```\n\nR has a special set of rules that cover this situation called the **recycling
  rules**. Whenever you call a binary vectorised fuction with inputs of different
  lengths, R will recycle the shorter vector to be the same length as the longer.
  This is particularly useful when combined with summary operators:\n\n``` r\nx -
  min(x)\n#>  [1] 83 59 15  0 44 47 27 68 71 79\n(x - mean(x)) / sd(x)\n#>  [1]  1.2024
  \ 0.3461 -1.2238 -1.7590 -0.1891 -0.0821 -0.7956  0.6672\n#>  [9]  0.7742  1.0597\n```\n\n(You
  can use recycling rules with vectors that are not of length 1, but that makes it
  easy to write confusing code, so I don't recommend it.)\n\nVectorised window functions\n---------------------------\n\nVectorised
  map functions can be generalised to vectorised **window** functions. In a window
  function the output now depends on a contiguous window of values (i.e. a sequence
  with no gaps). Map functions are a special case of window functions because in a
  map function, the \"window\" is just a single value.\n\n### Offset\n\nThe simplest
  type of window is an offset. Each output value still depends on only a single input
  value, but the input and output are no longer aligned. The following diagram illustrates
  offsets in either direction.\n\n<img src=\"diagrams/offset.png\" width=\"310\" />\n\nIn
  dplyr you can use `lead()` (positive) and `lag()` (negative) to look at offsets.\n\n```
  r\ntibble(\n  x = 1:5,\n  pos = lead(x),\n  neg = lag(x)\n)\n#> # A tibble: 5 ×
  3\n#>       x   pos   neg\n#>   <int> <int> <int>\n#> 1     1     2    NA\n#> 2
  \    2     3     1\n#> 3     3     4     2\n#> 4     4     5     3\n#> 5     5    NA
  \    4\n```\n\nChange the number of positions to look ahead or behind with the second
  argument, `n`.\n\nRemember that these are vectorised functions, so the output must
  be the same length as the input. That means we need to pad either the beginning
  or the end of the vector. `lead()` and `lag()` pad with `NA` but you can change
  this value with the `default` argument.\n\n`lead()` and `lag()` are very useful
  when combined with a binary vectorised map:\n\n-   `x == lag(x)` tells you if `x`
  has changed compared to the previous value.\n\n-   `x - lag(x)` tells you how `x`
  has changed.\n\n### Rolling\n\nRolling window functions are the next step up in
  complexity. Instead of a window of size one, they now have a fixed window of size
  `m`.\n\n<img src=\"diagrams/rolling.png\" width=\"166\" />\n\nNeither base R not
  dplyr provide rolling functions, but you can get them from the RcppRoll package.
  By default the `roll_` functions are not vectorised (they return shorter vectors),
  but you can make them vectorised by setting `fill = NA`.\n\n``` r\nlibrary(RcppRoll)\n\ntibble(\n
  \ x = 1:5,\n  roll_sum = roll_sum(x, 2, fill = NA),\n  roll_mean = roll_mean(x,
  2, fill = NA)\n)\n#> # A tibble: 5 × 3\n#>       x roll_sum roll_mean\n#>   <int>
  \   <dbl>     <dbl>\n#> 1     1        3       1.5\n#> 2     2        5       2.5\n#>
  3     3        7       3.5\n#> 4     4        9       4.5\n#> 5     5       NA        NA\n```\n\nYou
  can control how the window is aligned to the data with the `align` argument. The
  following figure shows `n = 3` and the three possible values of `align`. Note that
  the output value is `NA` if there are less than 3 inputs.\n\n<img src=\"diagrams/rolling-dir.png\"
  width=\"544\" />\n\n### Cumulative\n\nThe next step up in complexity are the cumulative
  functions, where the window size is no longer constant. A cumulative function uses
  all values up to the current position.\n\n<img src=\"diagrams/cumulative.png\" width=\"139\"
  />\n\nBase R includes the cumulative functions `cumsum()`, `cumprod()`, `cummax()`,
  and `cummin()`. dplyr provides a few others: `cummean()`, `cumany()`, `cumall()`.
  I'm not aware of any useful cumulative functions for strings or date/times.\n\n```
  r\nlibrary(RcppRoll)\n\ntibble(\n  x = 1:5,\n  cumsum = cumsum(x),\n  cummean =
  cummean(x)\n)\n#> # A tibble: 5 × 3\n#>       x cumsum cummean\n#>   <int>  <int>
  \  <dbl>\n#> 1     1      1     1.0\n#> 2     2      3     1.5\n#> 3     3      6
  \    2.0\n#> 4     4     10     2.5\n#> 5     5     15     3.0\n```\n\n### Complete\n\nThe
  most complex type of window function is the **complete** window function, where
  every output value depends on every input value.\n\n<img src=\"diagrams/complete.png\"
  width=\"139\" />\n\nThis class of window function includes all the ranking functions,
  because the rank of any value depends on the rank of all the other values. There
  are three key ranking functions that differ in how ties are handled:\n\n``` r\ntibble(\n
  \ x = c(10, 10, 10, 20, 20, 30),\n  min = min_rank(x),\n  dense = dense_rank(x),\n
  \ row_number = row_number(x)\n)\n#> # A tibble: 6 × 4\n#>       x   min dense row_number\n#>
  \  <dbl> <int> <int>      <int>\n#> 1    10     1     1          1\n#> 2    10     1
  \    1          2\n#> 3    10     1     1          3\n#> 4    20     4     2          4\n#>
  5    20     4     2          5\n#> 6    30     6     3          6\n```\n\nUse `desc()`
  if you want the highest inputs to have the lowest ranks.\n\n`min_rank()` works like
  sports ranking: if there are three people tied for first place, the next rank is
  4th place. `dense_rank()` ensures that the ranks are \"dense\", i.e. it doesn't
  skip any ranks for ties. `row_number()` breaks ties so that every row gets a unique
  number. It's easiest to understand the differences in terms of filtering:\n\n-   `min_rank(x)
  <= 2` will select all elements in first place, and will only select another if there
  wasn't a tie for first.\n\n-   `dense_rank(x) <= 2` will select all elements tied
  for first place, and all elements tied for the next rank.\n\n-   `row_number(x)
  <= 2` will always select exactly two elements.\n\n### Ordering\n\nSo far we've dodged
  the question of what we mean by \"before\" and \"after\", relying on the order of
  the rows. There are three ways to be more precise:\n\n-   `arrange()` the data so
  you know exactly how the rows are ordered.\n\n-   Use the `order_by` argument (if
  present), to order by a specific variable. This is more efficient than `arrange()`
  if you're only computing a single window function.\n\n-   Use the `order_by()` helper
  if there is no `order_by` argument.\n\nThe main difference between the `arrange`
  and `order_by` is what happens to the other columns:\n\n``` r\ndf <- tribble(\n
  \ ~time, ~ value,\n      7,       3,\n      1,       5,\n      5,       -2,\n      3,
  \      0\n)\n\ndf %>% \n  arrange(time) %>%\n  mutate(cumulate = cumsum(value))\n#>
  # A tibble: 4 × 3\n#>    time value cumulate\n#>   <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl>\n#> 1     1
  \    5        5\n#> 2     3     0        5\n#> 3     5    -2        3\n#> 4     7
  \    3        6\n\ndf %>% \n  mutate(cumulate = order_by(time, cumsum(value)))\n#>
  # A tibble: 4 × 3\n#>    time value cumulate\n#>   <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl>\n#> 1     7
  \    3        6\n#> 2     1     5        5\n#> 3     5    -2        3\n#> 4     3
  \    0        5\n```\n"
