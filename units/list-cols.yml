  List columns are a powerful way to extend data frames to contain arbitrary
  data types: you've seen them with spatial data, and you'll find them useful
  when you start working with many models.

  Data frames are useful because they keep together related vectors;
  list-columns allow you to continue to use data frames even as you data
  structures get more complicated.
