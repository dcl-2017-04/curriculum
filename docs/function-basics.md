Functions are powerful tool for reducing the amount of duplication in your
code. Reducing duplication is a good principle because it means that
each "fact" in your code is only stored in one place. When the requirements
of your code change (as they invariably do), you only need to make the
change in a single place, reducing the chances of inconsistencies within
your code.
