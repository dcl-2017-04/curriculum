# Models with multiple variables
<small>(Builds on: [Visualising models](model-vis.md))</small>

Models with a single variable can be useful (if you want to remove a single
strong trend), but almost every real model contains multiple variables. In
this unit, you'll learn how to visualise these more complicated models,
including models for categorical data (i.e. factors).
