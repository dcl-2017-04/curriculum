Instead of using one big, complicated visualisations, it's often better to
use a sequence of simpler visualisations. The same principle applies with
modelling: often you can replace a single complex model (which might be
hard to understand) with a set of simpler models.

In this unit you'll learn how to combine modelr, tidyr, and purrr to
fit many simple models to a single dataset.
