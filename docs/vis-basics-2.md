<small>(Leads to: [Labelling your graphics](vis-labelling.md), [The grammar of graphics](vis-theory.md))</small>

Now it's time to learn some more of the components that make up ggplot2.

*  __Statistical transformations__, or stats for short, allow you to plot
   summaries of the data and are needed for important visualisations like
  the histogram.

* __Position adjustments__ help handle overlapping objects. They're essential
  for bar graphs, but are also useful for point data.

* __Coordinate systems__ control how the x and y aesthetics map to position
  on the plot. You'll use them least of any ggplot2 component, but when
  you do need them they're invaluable.

* You'll also learn a bit about the underlying theory of ggplot2,
  the __layered grammar of graphics__.

Finally, you'll learn a more compact style of ggplot2 calls that you'll
use throughout the rest of the course.
